<analysis>
The previous AI engineer developed an Equipment Management full-stack application using FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The initial phase focused on building core features and robust deployment scripts, including extensive debugging for various environment issues. Subsequent work involved implementing new features as per user feedback: enhanced equipment data, sensor values (Zero/SPAN), a new Departamento field for clients, and a sophisticated PDF certificate generation system. The engineer iteratively refined the PDF design, certificate numbering, and spare parts management based on user requests. Debugging was a continuous process, often involving backend logs (for 400/500 errors) and frontend console errors. The current task is to resolve an issue where the generated PDF certificate is failing due to an oversized company logo, which is causing page overflow.

<product_requirements>
The application is a web-based Equipment Management system in Spanish with a modern design and MongoDB backend. Key functionalities include:
1.  **Equipment Entry**: Form for new equipment details (Marca, Modelo - incrementable, Cliente - incrementable with Name, CIF, Departamento, N√∫mero de Serie, Observaciones, Fecha de Entrada). Auto-completion of equipment data by serial number, loading only Sensor, Pre-Alarma, and Alarma from past entries.
2.  **Equipment Review**: Search by serial number to retrieve previous entry data. Form to fill Sensor, Pre-Alarma, Alarma, Valor Calibraci√≥n, Valor de Zero, Valor de SPAN, Botella de Calibraci√≥n, and APTO check. Supports a dynamic list of used spare parts (Descripci√≥n, Referencia, Garant√≠a). Displays Pending Equipment for Review table.
3.  **Equipment Output**: List of calibrated, not-yet-departed equipment. Allows selection, entry of delivery note, and location. Displays Client and Departamento. Expandable rows to show calibration table and spare parts. Automatically downloads PDF certificate upon output.
4.  **Equipment Summary**: Table showing departed equipment (Marca, Modelo, N¬∫ de Serie, Cliente, Fecha de Salida, Tiempo en Taller).
5.  **Equipment History (New)**: New page (fifth menu option) to search by serial number, view all historical calibrations (date, technician, status), Client, Departamento, with expandable rows for calibration details and spare parts. Includes a button to download past certificates.
The PDF certificate must be modern, single-page, include a legal text, company logo (top-left, green, transparent background), equipment/client data (with Departamento), sensor table (with Zero/SPAN), used parts (showing GARANT√çA: S√ç/NO), technician's digital signature, delivery note, and a correlative certificate number (YY-NNNNN).

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



-   ****: The core FastAPI application.
    -   **Importance**: Handles API endpoints, business logic, and database interactions.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for client departments, sensor zero/span values, equipment catalog, historical calibration, correlative certificate numbering, and  list handling (Pydantic to dict conversion for MongoDB). JWT exception handling was corrected.
-   ****: Module for PDF certificate generation.
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes logic for creating calibration certificates.
    -   **Changes**: Redesigned for modern, single-page layout; integrated legal text, dynamic spare parts with GARANT√çA status, delivery note, certificate number, and adjusted logo placement/sizing. Currently facing an issue with logo dimensions.
-   ****: Environment variables for the backend.
    -   **Importance**: Stores , , , .
    -   **Changes**:  updated to include local IPs.  confirmed as test_database.
-   ****: Main React component, defines routes.
    -   **Importance**: Entry point for frontend routing.
    -   **Changes**: Added route for  ().
-   ****: React component for equipment entry.
    -   **Importance**: Manages new equipment form.
    -   **Changes**: Added Departamento field to client form, implemented auto-completion for equipment data by serial number, and updated client modal to allow multiple departments.
-   ****: React component for equipment review.
    -   **Importance**: Handles calibration data entry.
    -   **Changes**: Added  and  fields, modified loading logic for sensors (only Sensor, Pre-Alarma, Alarma persistent), and introduced a dynamic input list for  with description, reference, and Garant√≠a checkbox. Removed auto-PDF download on calibration.
-   ****: React component for equipment output.
    -   **Importance**: Manages equipment delivery.
    -   **Changes**: Added Departamento column to the table, implemented expandable rows to display calibration details and spare parts, and added automatic PDF download on output.
-   ** (New)**: React component for equipment history.
    -   **Importance**: Provides a historical view of all calibrated equipment.
    -   **Changes**: Initial creation to display all reviewed equipment (Client, Departamento), with expandable rows for calibration and spare parts, and certificate download buttons.
-   ****: Layout component.
    -   **Importance**: Manages overall application layout and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Added Historial de Equipos to the sidebar navigation.

</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Adjust the size and aspect ratio of the ASCONSA logo in  to prevent it from being deformed and to ensure it fits correctly within the PDF layout, as it's currently causing an error due to being too large.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate work is to resolve a critical runtime error in the frontend that occurs when trying to register an equipment output, which subsequently triggers a backend error during PDF certificate generation. The user reported  and then a more specific error: . This detailed error indicates that the ASCONSA logo in  is too large (510 x 1778 points) and is causing the PDF content to overflow the page. The AI engineer has successfully diagnosed the problem and is about to implement a fix to resize the logo.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Reduce the dimensions of the ASCONSA logo in  to ensure it fits the PDF template correctly.
